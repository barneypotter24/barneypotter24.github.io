My name is Barney Isaksen Potter. I have the following qualities:

- I am mostly empty space
- I have lived in Belgium for over five years
- I wear number 24
- I am a sad, sad Seattle Mariners fan
- My favorite food is [okonomiyaki](https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki/), and my favorite color is probably <span style="color: #260339">â– </span> `#260339`, or something similar
- I like dogs

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_%26_Friends) and it will answer **all** your questions.
