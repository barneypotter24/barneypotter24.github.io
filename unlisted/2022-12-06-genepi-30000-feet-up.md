# What is genomic epidemiology?

<!-- The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic saw an explosion of public scientific communication across various platforms of the Internet. -->
<!-- This was of course catalyzed by the strict measures that many countries began to put in place in early-to-mid 2020 to slow the spread of their local epidemics. -->
<!-- As epidemiologists, virologists, statisticians, and other took to Twitter and other online platforms to share results among one another--bypassing the lengthy academic review process--many researchers began to make their research results easily accessible to the public. -->
<!-- One group for which this explosion of Twitter content became very visible to me personally came through the lens of genomic epidemiology and phylodynamics. -->
<!-- As an early-career researcher, it was very nice for me to be able to immediately see the work being done by some of the leaders of my field of research, and to get to interact with them from time to time in a way that would have been previously very difficult. -->
<!-- It was a great learning opportunity to help me understand the field better, reading updates constantly through the voices of many different people at once. -->
<!-- With that in mind, I thought it may be good to briefly talk about some of the high-level lessons that I learned about how phylogenetic inference can help us understand both the evolution and spread of pathogens. -->

<!-- To that end, I think we should first ask ourselves: -->

The CDC's [COVID-19 Genomic Epidemiology Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/amd/pdf/slidesets/toolkitmodule_1.1-508c.pdf) provides the following definition for genomic epidemiology:

> [The] use of pathogen genomic data to determine
> the distribution and spread of an infectious disease in a specified
> population and the application of this information to control health
> problems.

To break this down, let's start with thinking about the epidemic process.
