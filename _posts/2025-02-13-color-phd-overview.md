I've just successfully defended my PhD, so I thought it would be a good time to both get in the habit of writing a little bit about the science that I do, and to give a very high-level overview of my dissertation.
I don't have the bandwidth to do all of that at once, so I'll try to write five posts, each corresponding to one of the five chapters of my PhD thesis.
