The 2022 Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary Biology conference just ended. While I have the post-conference energy (and a free evening in a hostel) I thought I may give writing blog posts a try. I would certainly like this to become something that I do--I won't get better at science communication if I don't practice--but we will see if the energy keeps up.

For the time being, I think it will be enough to do a little debrief of the conference so that I can organize my thoughts a little bit, and give a few kudos to some of the people whose research and company made MCEB a great experience.

I have been made to understand that MCEB takes place in a stunning location each year, and Château d'Oex, a village in the Swiss Alps a bit west of Lake Geneva. After a few years of living in Belgium I had started to forget just how spectacular mountains can be.

When I was on my way to the conference I was talking to a friend of mine who a few steps ahead of me in his career. I mentioned to him I was on the way to MCEB and he said "Is that the PhD student conference?" I didn't realize it at the time, but this was a very apt description. It felt like the overwhelming majority of the 40ish people there were early-career researchers, and it seemed geared to creating an environment where folks who were newer to the field could thrive. There were talks given by people ranging from first-year PhD to senior PI, and regardless of the experience the questions, comments, and feedback seemed overwhelmingly positive, constructive, and non-critical. It really felt like a great atmosphere for early-career researchers to learn how to talk about the science that they are doing in a supportive environment. I'd like to give kudos to all the people whose various efforts made this the case.

The content of the conference itself covered a rather broad range of topics. The most-covered topic (fortunately, as it is the one with which I am the most familiar) was viral phylodynamics. While I won't cover every talk and poster that I liked, I will make mention of the keynote given by Denise Kühnert, both on SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology, and on HBV phylodynamics using ancient sequences to inform evolutionary rate estimates. These have been the two main topics of my PhD thusfar, so I'm glad to finally get the chance to hear her present on the reserach that her group has been doing.

Given the nature of the conference, there were also many talks on various phylogenetic models. A few presentations of note to me (meaning I need to go back and read the papers now) were those by Somayeh Mashayekhi on the Fractional Coalescent, which relaxes the assumption of fixed-variance reproductive rates within the coalescent, Luka Nesterenko's presentation on Neural Networks as a mechanism for more robust distance-based phylogenetic reconstruction, and Paul Bastide's presentation on Cauchy models for continuous trait evolution on phylogenies. I certainly could not follow all the details that were presented (by no fault of the presenters), but for these and several more similar talks I will definitely be going back to dig into the details that I could not understand from the short presentations.

One talk that I particularly appreciated was that by David Bryant on the history of the debate surrounding how to combine data from many genes in the inference of species trees. As an early career researcher I particularly appreciate keynote talks that explain some of the problems, solutions, and debates that have shaped the history of the field. Having not experienced these debates as they were happening I very much appreciate the opportunity to get a little bit of historical perspective on the field. I was discussing with a colleague that it would be nice if all conferences made more of an effort to encourage more historical perspectives talks to help shepherd early-career folks into the conversation.

Of course there were many more interesting talks, not to mention the poster sessions. There was almost nothing that I wasn't at least somewhat interested by (and in defense of the "uninteresting", they were exclusively on topics that I am so uneducated in that I didn't have the background knowledge to be interested--I'm sure that they were actually as interesting and engaging as everything else to the people who know what they were about).

In an effort to try to reflect a little bit and figure out how I can take the enthusiasm that MCEB fostered and keep it going in a productive way, I think it would be good to address a few action points for myself moving forward.

1. I need to read more. Much, much more. On the way back to Geneva from the conference I was discussing with a colleague how, despite having done a PhD-appropriate level of work during the pandemic lockdowns, it doesn't feel like we've necessarily done a comparable amount of learning. Just the baseline level of knowledge that I feel like I have right now feels insufficient to be able to get the most out of future meetings and collaborations.
2. I need to collaborate more. Other than my immediate colleagues, this has been my first real opportunity to meet and talk to my peers from around the field, to say nothing of the post-docs and PIs who I also got a chance to chat with. I feel pretty close to my PhD siblings (if I may steal the phrase from Gytis Dudas), but I did realize that we don't talk shop much. So I think I stand to gain a lot from both working collaboratively with my immediate peers, as well as making more effort to collaboratte and share ideas beyond my immediate scope.
3. I need to travel more. This isn't immediately related to research, but I was struck by how much effect going to a new place and hearing new voices talk about new things motivated me to work harder and do better science. This really made obvious to me how much satisfaction I get from the reserach world that I'm involved in. Learning a new thing hits that little endorphin button in my brain, I want to keep that up.

Writing this feels a bit soap-boxy, so I think I'm going to condense this into some more concrete bullets:
* Read [Phylogenetics in the Genomics ERA](https://hal.inria.fr/PGE) as part of the journal club that my colleagues have
* When that is done read Inferring Phylogenies cover-to-cover
* Read the Phylogenetic Handbook

I know I should be able to derive/explain a tree likelihood, the coalescent, and MCMC from first-principles on a whiteboard, but at this point I cannot. Hopefully actually reading these books will concrete the details of these in my head.

* Understand how Birth-Death models work
* Clear up my knowledge of extensions of the Coalescent (in particular structured coalescent and multispecies coalescent)
* Learn a bit more about population genetics

For all these things I know enough to get by, but I feel the need to know them in much more detail. In particular, it felt like Birth-Death models were used by everyone who was attempting to make actionable inferences for epidemic responses. I need to understand this better.

* Write blog posts summarizing small not-for-publication results
* Learn Julia and Rust
* Reach out to the people I met and follow up on the conference

All of these things are sort of research-adjacent, but they all feel like they would be very important for me moving forward. I want to be good at communicating science so the first and third bullets will help with that. I think Julia and Rust are, in a way, the path forward so I would like to pair-program some projects in them to both learn the languages and to get better at collaborative programming.
