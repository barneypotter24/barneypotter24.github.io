                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I recently started a position as a Research Assistant at <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</a> in Seattle, Washington. I am working in the <a href="bedford.io">lab</a> of Trevor Bedford. In the Bedford lab, I am working on adding new functionality to the websites <a href="nextflu.org">nextflu.org</a> and <a href="nextstrain.org">nextstrain.org</a>. Additionally, I am investigating the use of deep learning to help better predict seasonal flu patterns.</p>
                    <p>I am a recent graduate of Reed College in Portland, Oregon. While I was there, I majored in Mathematics and Biology. My studies were primarily focused on computational biology and bioinformatics. I have spent the last several years studying the effects of whole genome duplication on the gene expression patterns of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/coatejeremy/">Jeremy Coate</a> while working in the lab of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/schaackwork/">Sarah Schaack</a>. During the last year, I have also worked with Anna Ritz and Jim Fix to create a method for modeling cell-signaling networks using directed hypergraphs. For my senior thesis at Reed, I developed a generalization of Prize-Collecting Steiner Trees, which allow us to model dysregulated subnetworks using gene expression data.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my research, I actively take part in the growing eSports community, both through learning how to make games in my free time, and by trying to promote eSports in my community. </p>

                    <p>Cell signaling pathways are important tools used by biologists to model how signals are transduced through cells. Though signaling pathways can be (and often are) modeled using graphs, we instead use a generalization known as "hypergraphs." Using these, we draw from the literature on hypergraphs and their traversal to develop the notion of a "hypershrub," a multi-source, multi-target generalization of a hyperpath. Drawing from the literature on Prize-Collecting Steiner trees and their applications to biological systems, we create a formulation that finds specific, prize-dense hypershrubs that may be representative of biological phenomena that went previously unnoticed in standard graph representations of the same signaling pathways. Finally, we apply this formulation to the human Hedgehog signaling pathway, and dysregulations therein, related to Basal Cell carcinoma to analyze the effectiveness of our algorithm in real data.</p>

                    <h3>Megadopsis</h3>
                    <p>Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) is an important part of the evolutionary history of modern angiosperm plants. WGD is though to be a driving force behind speciation because mutations can accumulate in duplicated genes without causing complete loss of function. Ancestral genome duplications have been studied in many angiosperms, some as recent as 500 thousand years ago, however little is currently known about the effect of WGD in the first several generations following a polyploidy event.</p>
                    <p>We seek to better understand the immediate effects of WGD on  the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> transcriptome. We have investigated both the change in transcriptome size following WGD, as well as investigated specific genes and gene families who are expressed differentially in the first several generations following WGD.</p>
